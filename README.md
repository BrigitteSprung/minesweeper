---

## Overview

## Project Timeline

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Approach Taken
Inspired by the Minesweeper project from Ania Kubow - [Minesweeper tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0No1JDc6vE&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)
Still todo:
- [] Better Styling
- [] Find the bug in the code
- [] Add in extra features

## Wins and Blockers

### Wins
- This helped me understand recursion in a really fun way

### Blockers
- I realised how much css I had forgotten coz I hadn't used it much recently

## Visuals and Featured Code

```JavaScript
// Deeply equal - check if position of square is at the edges
const isLeftEdge = (i % width === 0)
const isRightEdge = (i % width === width - 1) // eg. 19 % 10 = 9 = 10 - 1
```
